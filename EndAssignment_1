Qusetion 1

Ans: Replicaset will create multiple pods but 
All places where we need to have one pod per node, we shall use daemon Set
---------------------------------------------------------

Qusetion 2:  Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number 
of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime

Ans: Increase number of replicas using kubectl scale deploy application --replicas=2 

------------------------------------------------------

Question 3:  You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. 
You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible.
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. 
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue

Ans: 
1. check the networking 
2. check that pod is functional
3. Check the port in yaml file
4. Check the application code

-------------------------------------------------
Voting App

8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.
Ans - 
1. On deleting voting pod, one voting pod gets deleted and new voting pod comes up because of replicaset. Application does not get impacted 
2. When we delete db pod, the result does not update or changes. For new dB scenarios, old data is lost and socket connection is lost between result pod and db
3. when we delete the worker pod, the connection between voting pod and result pod breaks.
